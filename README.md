# Sign Language Recognition and Translation using Motion Tracking and Deep Learning

This repository is a sanitized version of my Final Year Project `Sign Language Recognition and Translation using Motion Tracking and Deep Learning`.

## About the Project

This project aims to continuously recognize Sign Language and translate them into a single sentence. It involves 2 different modules.
- A LSTM model for sign language recognition; and
- A language model for translation from glosses to sentences.

The original FYP project aims to translate Hong Kong Sign Language, but in practice this model can support any language as long as you make your own dataset.

## Usage

To set up the project, follow the instructions in `docs/setup.md`.

Aftewards, modify your config file if needed. Refer to `docs/config.md`.
